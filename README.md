this entire practice is inspired by:
https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/
the original author is Tania Rascia

didn't do a lot changes from the original code, just use it as a chance to practice react

also note that this project can't run without node.js environment, need to use "npm start" to run the project
